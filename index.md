# Elevator Pitch
### Problem
Noise complaints are a common issue in shared buildings. These complaints can often lead to disputes, unfair accusations, and unresolved tension between tenants

### Solution
A software-enabled noise detector that will be paired with a mobile or web app to monitor decibel levels, without recording audio. When noise levels are exceeded for an extended period the system will log the event and generate a report for property managers.

### Key Features
- Decibel Tracking
- Real time alerts
- Noise history dashboard
- Auto generated incident reports

### Benefits
Tenants enjoy peace and quiet, protection from false complaints and property managers receive unbiased data to resolve disputes.

### Outcome
A more peaceful, quiet, and respectful living environment, driven by transparent data and ethical technology.

# Problem Description
In shared living environments, current noise complaint processes rely heavily on subjective reports, leading to unresolved disputes, false accusations, and tenant dissatisfaction. There is no efficient, unbiased, or privacy-conscious method for tracking and verifying noise disturbances over time.

# Customer and End User Risk
### Risk: Hesitation to use the Sapphire Sound App or sensor device
Tenants may feel the system is unfair and intrusive, or they may distrust Sapphire Sound altogether. This could lead to low adoption and limited participation. We assess this to be a quite likely probability because of privacy concerns and low initial trust. This would lead to a lack of consistent coverage for noise enforcement across the community and an unhappy customer.

### Mitigations
- Clearly communicate privacy safeguards (no audio recording, only decible level notifications)
- Add tenant-friendly features like real-time alerts and rewards
- Engage community leaders or property managers to champion the system
